Mormon;United Kingdom;Latter Day Saint;"Term for a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) which was coined by early opposition and put into use by newspapers in Missouri and Illinois who didn't want to refer to the Latter-day Saints as Christians or Saints, and so used a word from one of their books of scripture, the Book of Mormon. Early leaders spoke out against this use of the term due to revelation given about the church's name, but because of broad use in the press and by locals who opposed the church, it remained in colloquial use. To this day, many refer to the LDS Church as the ""Mormon Church,"" though leaders have been asking to be referred to by their proper name since 1838. However, the term ""Mormon"" has been used in the church's television advertising to refer to its members. There has been a renewed effort starting in 2018 to avoid the use of the term. There is some disagreement within the LDS Church if the term is offensive, or just less preferred. Some style guides consider ""Mormon"" to be the appropriate term in many historical (Mormon pioneers, Mormon Battalion, Mormon Trail) and demographic contexts, as Mormons are not exclusively members of the LDS Church. There are other denominations in which the term is not offensive and may be preferred. (List of denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement)";;
