In the following pages, the similarities and differences between the recent refugee crisis and the expulsion of the German speaking population from eastern Europe following the end of World War II are drawn up. The difficulties and feasibility of overcoming todayâ€™s refugee crisis are put in relation to the task of the 1940s. This happens from a purely German perspective and concludes that, albeit the future is always uncertain, the recent refugee crisis in Europe should not be more difficult to solve considering the resources and capabilities of both eras.
